Firstly, please accept my apologies for the sometimes messy and possibly 
unintelligible code. This was my first large project.

Netpack.py should run "out of the box" in Windows, but compiling is a bit
messier.

To compile, you'll need Python, Pygame, and the correct version of py2exe
installed.

The icon file (np_icon.ico) never looks right on my computer, but maybe you'll
have better luck with it.

To compile, cd to the src/ directory and run the pygame2exe.py script.
Sometimes, pygame2exe throws a "WindowsError: The directory is not empty"
exception, but if you keep brute-forcing the script, it will (should) eventually
work.

The compiled EXE will be in the dist/ folder.

I went through hell and back figuring out how to put a relative link outside
this folder, eventually writing a BAT script and converting that into an EXE.
If you really want instructions about this final aesthetic step, just email me.

Have fun!
